colsplit
========

A Python project aiming at finding homogeneous sub columns of a free text column.

To use colsplit do the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/patrickwestphal/colsplit.git
pip install -e colsplit/
```

Maybe you will have to install [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) on your system first.
To use the colsplit standalone tool just call `colsplit -h` and have a look at the command line options.
